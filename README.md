**Radio Weak Lensing shear measurement in the Visibility Domain**

1. Simulation of a faint radio catalog populated by star-forming galaxies according to flux, scalelength, ellipticity distributions estimated by JVLA observations (SWIRE and COSMOS). The number of galaxies is dependent on the flux prior and provided flux-cut.
2. Applying effect of an input reduced cosmic shear to galaxies ellipticity.
3. Simulation of the corresponding visibilities observed by a radio telescope.
4. Source extraction (providing source position and flux)
5. Source shape measurement, according RadioLensfit methodology
6. Shear measurement from the measured ellipticity of the galaxies in the field of view.
